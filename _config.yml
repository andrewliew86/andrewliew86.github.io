  Hi there! I'm a former Microbiologist turned Data Scientist/Analyst, with a passion for harnessing the power of AI, natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and data visualization to uncover hidden stories in data. I am also a video game, Raspberry Pi and bushwalking enthusiast.
