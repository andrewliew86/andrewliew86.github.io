### Expert profiling platform

Bibliometrics often allows a researcher to quickly identify prominent, highly published authors who are likely to be leaders in the field. In this project, I use R, VOS viewer and open-source data from EuropePMC to identify these experts.

### ChatGPT for scientific documents

Scientific papers are often long and contain technical jargon. In this proof of concept study, I utilized several open access libraries (LangChain, Hugging Face) in Python and open-weights large language models (Mistral-7B and Zephyr-7B-Beta) to create ChatGPT-like chatbots that can summarize and answer questions from an uploaded scientific PDF document.

### Fine-tuning language models for biomedical text analysis

Pre-trained language models such as BERT can often be fine-tuned on biomedical data to improve their ability to perform domain-specific tasks. In this proof of concept study, I fine-tuned a small BERT uncased model to perform text classification and extractive Q&A using the Hugging Face/transformers library in Python.

### Text analysis of pet adoption websites

Adopting a pet can be a daunting experience without proper research. In this project, I wanted to determine the key themes in the description of cats that were available for adoption in Melbourne using methods such as topic modelling and scattertext in Python. I also used basic machine learning models to determine factors that could influence adoption fees.
