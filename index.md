### Expert profiling platform

Bibliometrics often allows a researcher to quickly and quantitatively identify prominent, highly published authors who are likely to be leaders in the field. In this project, I use R, VOSviewer and open-source data from EuropePMC to identify these experts.

### Chatting with scientific documents

Scientific papers are often long and contain technical jargon. In this proof of concept project, I utilized several open access Python libraries (LangChain, Hugging Face/Transformers) and open-weights large language models (Mistral-7B and Zephyr-7B-Beta) to create ChatGPT-like chatbots that can summarize and answer questions from an uploaded scientific PDF document.

### Deploying a text-to-image model as a serverless endpoint

Stable Diffusion 2 is a cutting-edge text-to-image model capable of generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. In this fun weekend project, I deployed Stable Diffusion 2 as a serverless endpoint on RunPod, leveraging its cloud GPU resources to handle real-time image generation. This setup enables efficient, scalable, and cost-effective deployment, making it easy to integrate AI-driven image generation into various applications.

### Fine-tuning language models for biomedical text analysis

Pre-trained language models such as BERT can often be fine-tuned on biomedical data to improve their ability to perform domain-specific tasks. In this project, I fine-tuned a small BERT uncased model to perform text classification and extractive Q&A using the Hugging Face/Transformers library in Python.

### Text analysis of pet adoption websites

Adopting a pet can be a daunting experience without proper research. The aim of this project was to determine the key themes in the description of cats that were available for adoption in Melbourne using methods such as LDA topic modelling and Scattertext in Python. I also experimented with basic machine learning models to determine factors that could influence adoption fees.
